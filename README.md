# YTMusic2Spotify
This basic Python program allows you to transfer a YT Music playlist to Spotify. This also includes manual viewing of the song titles too.

Setup:
1. Make sure to run the setup.py file first to set up the headers JSON file for YT Music.
2. Add the credentials of your Spotify app in Spotify Developer Tools.
3. Change the top_search_results if you wish to display more search results.
4. Change the ytmusic_playlist to your desired YT Music playlist.
5. Change the spotify_playlist_id to the Spotify playlist url.
6. Run the main.py.
  
Things to remember:
* Y: Include authors in the Spotify Search
* N: Do not include authors in the Spotify Search
* S: Skip the search for that song
* X: Terminate

When picking the number to add to the playlist:
* Inputting 1-top_search_results: Will add that song to the Spotify playlist
* S/X: Skip adding the song
